          <p class="card-text">The world today is facing an unprecedented challenge in the form of COVID 19. Economies have fallen, mighty nations have surrendered and life as man knows it, has been reduced to the confines of their homes. And while the world is battling the virus, here in our country we have another war also to win. Thousands of migrant workers and daily wagers have been left jobless in the wake of the current state of lockdown which has affected children and women the most. And while most of us are worrying about our kidsâ€™ education, our job, our future, our businesses and its prospects and how to handle time at home in isolation or simply getting bored at home. The less privileged ones have only one worry.</p>

          <h2 class="card-title">Shiksha Na Rukhe</h2>
          <p class="card-text">One of the most affected victims of the pandemic are children who now have no access to schools. While a lot of children have the means for online classes, underprivileged children are still deprived of learning as they have no access to computers or smart phones. These children already have had difficult journeys, having fought the shackles of poverty, child labour, and much more to finally reach school. But the pandemic has reversed their years of struggle.

            For lakhs of such children, education has come to a halt. They can't afford smart phones, can't count on support of parents for home learning. Shiksha Na Ruke is a Smile Foundation initiative that is providing underprivileged children access to continuous learning. Despite everything, they have not given up on education, they continue to dream. Join hands with us to help these little dreamers continue their education.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Happiness is real, only when it is shared!
            A full plate of food filled with the goodness of nutrients is nourishing, gives one strength; both bodily and mental, keeps one active and free from diseases. One of the most important aspect for any kind of development is taking care of children, enabling them to grow up healthy. But the prevailing situation in India speaks otherwise, we have constantly failed to provide the most basic care to our children, providing healthy meals to them which results in stunted growth, malnourishment etc.</p>

          <p class="card-text">A mother, a sister, a daughter, a home-maker, a teacher, a doctor, a leader; women hold our worlds together in a million ways.A girl child comes into this world with just as many expectations, dreams and aspiration as a boy, but soon finds out that her way towards achieving them is much more challenging. The mere absence of an education and the many different set of rules that a girl has to follow according to the norms of the society makes her suffer mentally, emotionally and physically from a very young age.</p>

          <h2 class="card-title">Health Cannot Wait</h2>
          <p class="card-text">The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has shaken up the entire country and seems to be even more devastating than the first. Fighting the new, more infectious variant of the virus, frontline health workers are working round the clock even as hospitals run out of beds and oxygen supply, and thousands succumb to preventable deaths.

            As the situation worsens with every passing day, the need of the hour is to provide urgent necessities like PPE kits to health workers, strengthening the existing public health infrastructure through supply of oxygen and medicines, reducing the load of primary healthcare facilities, providing hygiene kits to masses, and spreading awareness to contain the spread of the virus. </p>
